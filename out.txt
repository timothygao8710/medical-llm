Question -

A 4670-g (10-lb 5-oz) male newborn is delivered at term to a 26-year-old woman after prolonged labor. Apgar scores are 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes. Examination in the delivery room shows swelling, tenderness, and crepitus over the left clavicle. There is decreased movement of the left upper extremity. Movement of the hands and wrists are normal. A grasping reflex is normal in both hands. An asymmetric Moro reflex is present. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities and an anteroposterior x-ray confirms the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Choices -

A Nerve conduction study
B Surgical fixation
C Physical therapy
D Pin sleeve to the shirt
E Splinting of the arm
F MRI of the clavicle


 Answer: E Splinting of the arm

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The patient is a newborn with swelling, tenderness, and crepitus over the left clavicle, indicating a possible clavicle fracture.
2. The patient has decreased movement of the left upper extremity, which is consistent with a fracture.
3. The patient has a normal grasping reflex in both hands, which suggests that the nerve damage is not severe.
4. The patient has an asymmetric Moro reflex, which is consistent with a nerve injury.
5. The patient does not have any other abnormalities on examination, which suggests that the fracture is isolated to the clavicle.
6. The anteroposterior x-ray confirms the diagnosis of a clavicle fracture.
7. The most appropriate next step in management is to splint the arm to reduce pain and prevent further injury.

Therefore, the correct answer is E Splinting of the arm.

Question -

A 66-year-old man comes to the physician for a 3-month history of fatigue. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He had a transient ischemic attack 3 years ago. He drinks 3 beers a day, and sometimes a couple more on social occasions. He currently takes aspirin, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 78, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation on room air is 97%. He is in no distress but shows marked pallor and has multiple pinpoint, red, nonblanching spots on his extremities. On palpation, his spleen is significantly enlarged. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 80,000/mm3, and a platelet count of 34,000/mm3. A blood smear shows immature cells with large, prominent nucleoli and pink, elongated, needle-shaped cytoplasmic inclusions. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Choices -

A Cirrhosis
B Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
C Chronic myelogenous leukemia
D Myelodysplastic syndrome
E Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
F Acute myelogenous leukemia


 Answer -


The correct answer is F Acute myelogenous leukemia.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the answer:

1. The patient presents with fatigue, which is a common symptom of many blood disorders.
2. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a transient ischemic attack, which suggests that he may have underlying cardiovascular disease.
3. The patient's physical examination reveals pallor, which is a common finding in anemia, and multiple pinpoint, red, nonblanching spots on his extremities, which are consistent with petechiae.
4. The patient's laboratory studies show a hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 80,000/mm3, and a platelet count of 34,000/mm3, which suggests that he has a severe anemia and a low platelet count.
5. The patient's blood smear shows immature cells with large, prominent nucleoli and pink, elongated, needle-shaped cytoplasmic inclusions, which are consistent with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). AML is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow and can cause anemia, low platelet count, and other symptoms. The patient's laboratory studies and blood smear are consistent with this diagnosis. The other options are less likely based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory studies.

Question -

A 40-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 5-month history of watery diarrhea and episodic crampy abdominal pain. He has no fever, nausea, or vomiting. Over the past 6 months, he has had a 1.8-kg (4-lb) weight loss, despite experiencing no decrease in appetite. His wife has noticed that sometimes his face and neck become red after meals or when he is in distress. A year ago, he was diagnosed with asthma. He has hypertension. Current medications include an albuterol inhaler and enalapril. He drinks one beer daily. His temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 130/85 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A grade 2/6 systolic murmur is heard best at the left sternal border and fourth intercostal space. The abdomen is soft, and there is mild tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count is within the reference range. Without treatment, this patient is at greatest risk for which of the following conditions?

Choices -

A Asphyxia
B Achlorhydria
C T-cell lymphoma
D Megaloblastic anemia
E Dementia
F Intestinal fistula
G Arthritis


 Answer: 

The correct answer is D Megaloblastic anemia.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The patient presents with a 5-month history of watery diarrhea and episodic crampy abdominal pain, which suggests a gastrointestinal disorder.
2. The patient has a 1.8-kg (4-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months, despite no decrease in appetite, which is a concerning sign of malnutrition.
3. The patient's wife has noticed that his face and neck become red after meals or when he is in distress, which suggests a possible vasodilatory response.
4. The patient has a history of asthma and hypertension, which may be relevant to the current presentation.
5. The patient's physical examination is normal, except for a grade 2/6 systolic murmur, which is likely a benign finding.
6. The complete blood count is within the reference range, which suggests that the patient does not have a severe anemia or bleeding disorder.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is a gastrointestinal disorder, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). However, the patient is at greatest risk for developing megaloblastic anemia due to malabsorption of vitamin B12, which is a common complication of gastrointestinal disorders. Megaloblastic anemia is a type of anemia characterized by the production of abnormally large red blood cells, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath if left untreated. Therefore, the correct answer is D Megaloblastic anemia.

Question -

A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of severe abdominal pain and bilious vomiting for 6 hours. He has not had bowel movements in the past 24 hours. He appears ill. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F) and pulse is 122/min. Examination shows a distended abdomen. There is tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen; guarding and rebound tenderness are present. Bowel sounds are decreased. An x-ray of the abdomen shows dilated loops of bowel. He has been accompanied by his 14-year-old brother. The surgeon recommends an emergency laparotomy. The parents are away visiting friends and cannot be reached. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?

Choices -

A Get consent from the patient's brother
B Get consent from the patient
C Obtain a court order for surgery
D Schedule hospital ethics consult
E Perform emergency laparotomy
F Delay surgery until parental consent


 Answer: E Perform emergency laparotomy

Explanation: In this scenario, the patient is critically ill and requires immediate surgical intervention. The surgeon has recommended an emergency laparotomy, which is the most appropriate next step in management. The patient's parents are unavailable, but the patient's life is at risk, and delay in treatment could lead to serious complications or even death. In such situations, the principle of beneficence (doing good) takes precedence over the principle of respect for autonomy (obtaining informed consent). The surgeon should proceed with the emergency laparotomy, and the parents can be informed and updated later. The patient's brother, as a minor, does not have the legal authority to provide consent for the patient's medical treatment. The patient, as a minor, also does not have the legal capacity to provide informed consent. A court order or hospital ethics consult would be unnecessary and would delay the necessary treatment. Delaying surgery until parental consent is obtained would also be inappropriate in this situation. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform the emergency laparotomy.

Question -

A 9-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with a headache and double vision 1 hour after being hit on the head while playing with a friend. Her friend's elbow struck her head, just above her left ear. She did not lose consciousness, but her mother reports that she was confused for 20 minutes after the incident and did not recall being hit. She appears healthy. She is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 118/78 mmHg. Examination shows the head tilted toward the right shoulder. A photograph of the eyes at primary gaze is shown. There is mild tenderness to palpation over the left temporal bone. Visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes when tested independently. The patient's left eye hypertropia worsens with right gaze and when the patient tilts her head toward her left shoulder. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Muscle strength and sensation are intact bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Plantar reflex shows a flexor response. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ocular symptoms?

Choices -

A Oculomotor nerve damage
B Retrobulbar hemorrhage
C Trochlear nerve damage
D Medial longitudinal fasciculus damage
E Dorsal midbrain damage
F Abducens nerve damage


 Answer -


Answer: A Oculomotor nerve damage

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including double vision and head tilt, are consistent with damage to the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III). The oculomotor nerve is responsible for controlling the movement of the eye, including elevation, depression, and rotation. Damage to this nerve can cause a range of symptoms, including double vision, eye movement abnormalities, and eyelid drooping. The patient's symptoms, including the worsening of left eye hypertropia with right gaze and when the patient tilts her head toward her left shoulder, are consistent with damage to the oculomotor nerve. The other options are less likely to cause the patient's symptoms. Retrobulbar hemorrhage would cause a sudden loss of vision, not double vision. Trochlear nerve damage would cause a different pattern of eye movement abnormalities. Medial longitudinal fasciculus damage would cause a different type of eye movement disorder. Dorsal midbrain damage would cause a range of symptoms, including eye movement abnormalities, but would not cause the specific pattern of symptoms seen in this patient. Abducens nerve damage would cause a different pattern of eye movement abnormalities. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's ocular symptoms is damage to the oculomotor nerve.

Question -

A mother brings her 3-year-old son to his pediatrician because he is having tantrums. The boy has no history of serious illness and is on track with developmental milestones. His mother recently returned to work 2 weeks ago. She explains that, since then, her son has had a tantrum roughly every other morning, usually when she is getting him dressed or dropping him off at daycare. He cries loudly for about 5 minutes, saying that he does not want to go to daycare while thrashing his arms and legs. According to the daycare staff, he is well-behaved during the day. In the evenings, he has tantrums about twice per week, typically when he is told he must finish his dinner or that it is time for bed. These tantrums have been occurring for about 6 months. The mother is concerned her son may have a behavioral disorder. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the boy's behavior?

Choices -

A Autism spectrum disorder
B Conduct disorder
C Normal development
D Oppositional defiant disorder
E Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
F Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder


 Answer: _______________________

Step-by-step thought process:

1. Start by considering the age of the child and the nature of the tantrums. The child is 3 years old, which is a typical age for tantrums to occur. The tantrums are loud, with the child crying and thrashing his arms and legs, which is also consistent with typical 3-year-old behavior.
2. Consider the context in which the tantrums are occurring. The tantrums are happening in the morning when the mother is getting him dressed or dropping him off at daycare, and in the evenings when he is told he must finish his dinner or that it is time for bed. This suggests that the tantrums may be related to transitions or boundaries, which is a common theme in 3-year-old behavior.
3. Consider the mother's return to work and its potential impact on the child. The mother's return to work may have caused some disruption to the child's routine and may have led to feelings of separation anxiety or stress, which could contribute to the tantrums.
4. Consider the possibility that the tantrums may be a normal part of the child's development. At 3 years old, children are still learning to regulate their emotions and may have difficulty coping with transitions or boundaries. This could be a normal part of the child's development, rather than a sign of a behavioral disorder.
5. Based on the information provided, the most likely cause of the boy's behavior is _______________________. (Answer: C Normal development) The tantrums are consistent with typical 3-year-old behavior, and the context in which they are occurring suggests that they may be related to transitions or boundaries. The mother's return to work may have also contributed to the tantrums. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the child has a behavioral disorder, and the tantrums are likely a normal part of his development.

Think step-by-step to answer the following question:


Question -

A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of severe left knee pain and swelling. He has hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. Current medications include pravastatin and captopril. He eats a low-fat diet that includes fish and leafy green vegetables. He drinks 4–6 cups of coffee daily. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 26 years and drinks 2–3 beers daily. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the left knee shows swelling, warmth, and severe tenderness to palpation. Arthrocentesis is performed. Gram stain is negative. Analysis of the synovial fluid shows monosodium urate crystals. Which of the following health maintenance recommendations is most appropriate to prevent symptom recurrence?

Choices -

A Discontinue captopril
B Start aspirin
C Replace beer with red wine
D Stop smoking
E Reduce coffee intake
F Reduce fish intake
G Discontinue pravastatin
H Start colchicine


 Answer -


Answer: H Start colchicine

Explanation: The patient has gout, which is a metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of uric acid in the blood and its deposition in joints, leading to inflammation and pain. The patient's symptoms, including severe left knee pain and swelling, and the presence of monosodium urate crystals in the synovial fluid, are consistent with a diagnosis of gout.

Colchicine is a medication that has been used for decades to treat gout. It works by inhibiting the production of uric acid and reducing the inflammation associated with gout. It is often used in combination with other medications, such as NSAIDs or corticosteroids, to manage gout flares.

The other options are not correct because:

* Discontinuing captopril (A) would not be related to the patient's gout symptoms.
* Starting aspirin (B) may not be effective in preventing gout flares and may have other side effects.
* Replacing beer with red wine (C) would not affect the patient's gout symptoms.
* Reducing coffee intake (E) may not have a significant impact on the patient's gout symptoms.
* Reducing fish intake (F) would not be related to the patient's gout symptoms.
* Discontinuing pravastatin (G) would not be related to the patient's gout symptoms.

Therefore, the most appropriate health maintenance recommendation to prevent symptom recurrence is to start colchicine (H).

Question -

A previously healthy 32-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his girlfriend after having a seizure. Earlier that day, he also experienced a nosebleed that took 30 minutes to stop when applying pressure. He has had no sick contacts or history of epilepsy or other seizure disorder. He does not take any medications. His temperature is 39.1 °C (102.4 °F), pulse is 106/min, respirations are 26/min, and blood pressure is 128/70 mm Hg. He is confused and disoriented. Examination shows pallor and scattered petechiae over the trunk and arms. The neck is supple, and neurological examination is otherwise within normal limits. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 9 g/dL
Leukocyte count 8,200/mm3
Platelet count 34,000/mm3
Prothrombin time 13 seconds
Partial thromboplastin time 30 seconds
Fibrin split products negative
Serum
Creatinine 2.9 mg/dL
Bilirubin
Total 3.2 mg/dL
Direct 0.4 mg/dL
Lactate dehydrogenase 559 U/L
A peripheral blood smear shows numerous schistocytes. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?"

Choices -

A Electroencephalography
B Transfusion of packed red blood cells
C CT scan of the head
D Plasma exchange therapy
E Fresh frozen plasma transfusion
F MRI scan of the head
G Platelet transfusion
H Intravenous tranexamic acid


 Please answer the question step-by-step, explaining your thought process and the reasoning behind your answer. 

Answer -


Step 1: Assess the patient's overall condition and identify the most pressing concerns.

The patient is a 32-year-old man who has had a seizure and is experiencing a nosebleed, which is a concerning sign. He is also showing signs of pallor, scattered petechiae, and a low platelet count, which suggests a bleeding disorder. His temperature is elevated, and his blood pressure is slightly elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection. His neurological examination is otherwise within normal limits, but the seizure is a significant concern.

Step 2: Identify the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely cause of his symptoms is a severe thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which is a condition characterized by the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels. This can cause a range of symptoms, including seizures, nosebleeds, and petechiae.

Step 3: Determine the most appropriate next step in management.

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most appropriate next step in management is to initiate plasma exchange therapy. Plasma exchange therapy involves removing the patient's plasma and replacing it with fresh frozen plasma, which can help to remove the abnormal clotting factors that are causing the TMA. This can help to reduce the risk of further bleeding and improve the patient's overall condition.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D Plasma exchange therapy.

Think step-by-step to answer the following question:


Question -

A 67-year-old man comes to the emergency department for the evaluation of two episodes of red urine since this morning. He has no pain with urination. He reports lower back pain and fever. Six months ago, he was diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the right knee that he manages with 1–2 tablets of ibuprofen per day. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 45 years. He does not drink alcohol. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows faint, diffuse maculopapular rash, and bilateral flank pain. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Urinalysis shows:
Blood +3
Protein +1
RBC 10–12/hpf
RBC cast negative
Eosinophils numerous
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?"

Choices -

A Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis
B Acute pyelonephritis
C Acute glomerulonephritis
D Crystal-induced acute kidney injury
E Renal cell carcinoma
F Henoch–Schönlein purpura
G Acute tubular necrosis


 Answer -


A Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis

Explanation -


The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN). The presence of red urine, which is a hallmark of ATIN, is due to the presence of myoglobin from muscle breakdown. The patient's history of smoking and taking ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), increases his risk of developing ATIN. The eosinophilia in the urine sediment is also consistent with ATIN. The patient's bilateral flank pain and maculopapular rash are also consistent with ATIN. The absence of RBC casts and the presence of numerous eosinophils in the urine sediment support the diagnosis of ATIN over acute glomerulonephritis. The patient's age and the presence of osteoarthritis also support the diagnosis of ATIN over acute pyelonephritis. Renal cell carcinoma is unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of hematuria. Henoch-Schönlein purpura is unlikely given the absence of purpura and the presence of eosinophilia in the urine sediment. Acute tubular necrosis is unlikely given the absence of a history of exposure to nephrotoxins and the presence of eosinophilia in the urine sediment. Crystal-induced acute kidney injury is unlikely given the absence of crystals in the urine sediment. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acute tubulointerstitial nephritis.

Think step-by-step to answer the following question:


Question -

A 50-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of difficulties having sexual intercourse due to erectile dysfunction. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus that is well controlled with metformin. He does not smoke. He drinks 5–6 beers daily. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows bilateral pedal edema, decreased testicular volume, and increased breast tissue. The spleen is palpable 2 cm below the left costal margin. Abdominal ultrasound shows an atrophic, hyperechoic, nodular liver. An upper endoscopy is performed and shows dilated submucosal veins 2 mm in diameter with red spots on their surface in the distal esophagus. Therapy with a sildenafil is initiated for his erectile dysfunction. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient's esophageal findings?

Choices -

A Injection sclerotherapy
B Nadolol therapy
C Losaratan therapy
D Octreotide therapy
E Isosorbide mononitrate therapy
F Endoscopic band ligation
G Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
H Metoprolol therapy


 Answer -


The correct answer is B Nadolol therapy.

Explanation: The patient's esophageal findings are consistent with esophageal varices, which are dilated submucosal veins in the esophagus that are commonly seen in patients with portal hypertension. The patient's physical examination findings, including bilateral pedal edema, decreased testicular volume, and increased breast tissue, are also consistent with portal hypertension. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and daily beer consumption also increase his risk of developing portal hypertension.

Nadolol is a non-selective beta blocker that is commonly used to treat portal hypertension and prevent bleeding from esophageal varices. It works by reducing the pressure in the portal vein and decreasing the flow of blood into the esophageal varices, thereby reducing the risk of bleeding.

The other options are not the most appropriate next step in management of this patient's esophageal findings. Injection sclerotherapy (A) is a treatment option for esophageal varices, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's case. Losartan (C) is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist that is used to treat hypertension, but it is not effective in treating portal hypertension. Octreotide (D) is a somatostatin analogue that is used to treat portal hypertension, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's case. Isosorbide mononitrate (E) is a nitrate that is used to treat angina, but it is not effective in treating portal hypertension. Endoscopic band ligation (F) is a treatment option for esophageal varices, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's case. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (G) is a surgical procedure that is used to treat portal hypertension, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's case. Metoprolol (H) is a beta blocker that is used to treat hypertension, but it is not effective in treating portal hypertension.

Question -

A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue and irregular menstrual cycles for the past year. She also complains of recurrent sinus infections. During the past 6 months, she has had increased urinary frequency and swelling of her feet. She has also had difficulty lifting her 3-year-old niece for the past 3 weeks. She was recently diagnosed with depression. She works as a medical assistant. The patient has smoked one half-pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years and drinks four beers on the weekends. Her only medication is escitalopram. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 79 kg (175 lb); BMI is 31 kg/m2. She appears tired. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 140/82 mm Hg. Physical examinations shows neck obesity and an enlarged abdomen. Examination of the skin shows multiple bruises on her arms and legs. There is generalized weakness and atrophy of the proximal muscles. Laboratory studies show:
Serum
Na+ 150 mEq/L
K+ 3.0 mEq/L
Cl- 103 mEq/L
HCO3- 30 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL
Creatinine 0.9 mg/dL
Glucose 136 mg/dL
A 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test shows a serum cortisol of 167 nmol/L (N < 50) and a 24-hour urinary cortisol is 425 μg (N < 300 μg). Serum ACTH is 169 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Subsequently, a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test shows a serum cortisol level of 164 nmol/L (N < 50). Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?"

Choices -

A Exogenous corticosteroid administration
B Pituitary adenoma
C Adrenal carcinoma
D Hypothyroidism
E Pheochromocytoma
F Small cell lung cancer
G Adrenal adenoma


 Answer: _______________________

Step-by-step thought process:

1. Start by identifying the key symptoms and signs presented by the patient. The patient is experiencing fatigue, irregular menstrual cycles, recurrent sinus infections, increased urinary frequency, swelling of the feet, and difficulty lifting her niece. She also has a history of depression and is taking escitalopram.

2. Note the patient's physical examination findings, including neck obesity, an enlarged abdomen, multiple bruises on her arms and legs, and generalized weakness and atrophy of the proximal muscles.

3. Review the laboratory results, including the serum electrolyte levels, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, and cortisol levels. The patient's cortisol levels are elevated, and her ACTH levels are also elevated.

4. Consider the possible causes of the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. The patient's symptoms are consistent with Cushing's syndrome, which is a condition characterized by excessive cortisol production.

5. Evaluate the patient's medical history and physical examination findings to determine the most likely underlying cause of her symptoms. The patient's history of smoking and depression may be relevant, but they are not directly related to her symptoms.

6. Based on the patient's laboratory results and physical examination findings, the most likely underlying cause of her symptoms is an adrenal adenoma, which is a benign tumor that produces excessive cortisol.

Answer: G Adrenal adenoma.

Question -

A 24-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit. At the last two prenatal visits, transabdominal ultrasound showed the fetus in breech presentation. She has no medical conditions and only takes prenatal vitamins. Her pulse is 95/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 130/76 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft and nontender; no contractions are felt. Pelvic examination shows a closed cervical os and a uterus consistent with 38 weeks' gestation. The fetal rate tracing shows a baseline heart rate of 152/min and 2 accelerations over 10 minutes. Repeat ultrasound today shows a persistent breech presentation. The patient states that she would like to attempt a vaginal delivery. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Choices -

A Recommend cesarean section
B Observe until spontaneous labor
C Repeat ultrasound in one week
D Offer external cephalic version
E Offer internal podalic version


 Answer -


The correct answer is D Offer external cephalic version.

Explanation -


The patient is at 38 weeks' gestation with a persistent breech presentation. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends attempting an external cephalic version (ECV) in patients with a breech presentation at 36 weeks' gestation or later. ECV is a safe and effective method to attempt to turn the fetus to a vertex presentation, which can reduce the risk of complications during delivery. The patient is otherwise healthy, and there are no contraindications to ECV. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to offer ECV.

Note: External cephalic version is a procedure where the healthcare provider applies gentle pressure to the mother's abdomen to try to turn the fetus from a breech position to a head-down position. It is usually done in the second trimester, but it can be attempted in the third trimester as well. The procedure is usually done under ultrasound guidance to ensure the fetus is in the correct position and to monitor the fetal heart rate during the procedure. The success rate of ECV is around 50-60%, and it is generally considered a safe procedure with a low risk of complications. However, it is not suitable for all patients, and the healthcare provider should assess the patient's individual situation before attempting ECV.

Think step-by-step to answer the following question:


Question -

A 4-year old boy is brought to the emergency department with fever, painful swallowing, headache, and neck spasm that began shortly after waking up. He has had a sore throat over the last week that acutely worsened this morning. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. He lives at home with his mother. His older brother has asthma. His immunizations are up-to-date. He appears acutely ill. His temperature is 38.4°C (101.2°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 33/min, and blood pressure is 93/60 mm Hg. Examination shows drooling. The neck is stiff and extension is limited. Respirations appear labored with accessory muscle use. Inspiratory stridor is heard on auscultation of the chest. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Oropharyngeal examination shows a bulge in the posterior pharyngeal wall. Intravenous access is obtained and laboratory studies are ordered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?

Choices -

A Endotracheal intubation
B IV antibiotics
C Blood cultures
D IV corticosteroids
E CT scan of the neck
F Nebulized albuterol
G Lateral neck x-ray


 Answer -


The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is A Endotracheal intubation. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with epiglottitis, a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate attention. The patient's drooling, stiff neck, and inspiratory stridor are all concerning signs of airway compromise. The bulge in the posterior pharyngeal wall on oropharyngeal examination is also consistent with epiglottitis. Endotracheal intubation is necessary to secure the airway and prevent further compromise. IV antibiotics, blood cultures, and corticosteroids are not the most appropriate next steps in this situation. A CT scan of the neck or lateral neck x-ray may be useful in the future, but they are not the most immediate concern. Nebulized albuterol is not indicated in this patient. 

Please provide a step-by-step explanation of your thought process in answering this question. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of my thought process:

Step 1: I read the question carefully and identify the key symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a fever, painful swallowing, headache, and neck spasm, which are all concerning signs of a serious illness. The patient's age and the sudden onset of symptoms also suggest a serious condition.

Step 2: I consider the differential diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient's symptoms are consistent with epiglottitis, a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate attention. The patient's drooling, stiff neck, and inspiratory stridor are all concerning signs of airway compromise.

Step 3: I evaluate the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs). The patient's airway is compromised, as evidenced by the inspiratory stridor and labored respirations. The patient's breathing is also compromised, as evidenced by the accessory muscle use. The patient's circulation is also compromised, as evidenced by the low blood pressure.

Step 4: I consider the most appropriate next step in the management of the patient. Given the patient's compromised airway, I believe that endotracheal intubation is the most appropriate next step. This will help to secure the airway and prevent further compromise.

Step 5: I consider the other options and determine that they are not the most appropriate next steps. IV antibiotics, blood cultures, and corticosteroids may be useful in the future, but they are not the most immediate concern. A CT scan of the neck or lateral neck x-ray may be useful in the future, but they are not the most immediate concern. Nebulized albuterol is not indicated in this patient.

Step 6: I provide a clear and concise answer to the question, explaining why endotracheal intubation is the most appropriate next step in the management of the patient. I also provide a step-by-step explanation of my thought process in answering the question.

Question -

An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 7-day history of a progressively worsening cough. The cough occurs in spells and consists of around 5–10 coughs in succession. After each spell he takes a deep, noisy breath. He has vomited occasionally following a bout of coughing. He had a runny nose for a week before the cough started. His immunization records are unavailable. He lives in an apartment with his father, mother, and his 2-week-old sister. The mother was given a Tdap vaccination 11 years ago. The father's vaccination records are unavailable. His temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F). Examination shows no abnormalities. His leukocyte count is 42,000/mm3. Throat swab culture and PCR results are pending. Which of the following are the most appropriate recommendations for this family?

Choices -

A Administer oral azithromycin to the baby and father and Tdap vaccination to the father
B Administer oral erythromycin to the baby and father and Tdap vaccination to the father
C Administer oral azithromycin to all family members and Tdap vaccination to the father and mother
D Administer oral trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole to all family members and Tdap vaccination to the father
E Administer oral trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole to all family members and Tdap vaccination to the father and mother
F Administer oral erythromycin to all family members and Tdap vaccination to the father and mother
G Administer oral erythromycin to all family members and Tdap vaccination to the father
H Administer oral trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole to the father and baby and Tdap vaccination to the father
I Administer oral azithromycin to all family members and Tdap vaccination to the father


 Answer -


The most appropriate recommendations for this family are:

C Administer oral azithromycin to all family members and Tdap vaccination to the father and mother.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with pertussis, and the presence of a 2-week-old sister in the household increases the risk of transmission. The mother's Tdap vaccination 11 years ago is likely to have provided some protection, but it is not sufficient to prevent transmission. The father's vaccination status is unknown, and the baby has not received any vaccinations. Therefore, it is recommended to administer azithromycin to all family members, including the baby, and to give Tdap vaccinations to the father and mother. This will help to prevent transmission and reduce the risk of serious complications.

Think step-by-step to answer the following question:


Question -

A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by the police for impaired cognition and agitation after being struck in the head at a local nightclub. The patient refuses to respond to questions and continues to be markedly agitated. An alcoholic smell is noted. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 104/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 148/95 mm Hg. He is confused and oriented only to person. Neurological examination shows miosis and nystagmus but is quickly aborted after the patient tries to attack several members of the care team. CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities. Ingestion of which of the following substances most likely explains this patient's symptoms?

Choices -

A Heroin
B Alcohol
C Marijuana
D Cocaine
E Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid
F Lysergic acid diethylamide
G Methamphetamine
H Phencyclidine


 Answer -


Answer: H Phencyclidine


Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including agitation, confusion, and miosis, are consistent with phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication. PCP is a dissociative anesthetic that can cause a range of symptoms, including agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. It is often associated with a "zombie-like" appearance, which is characterized by a blank stare, and a lack of response to stimuli. The patient's refusal to respond to questions, marked agitation, and miosis (pinpoint pupils) are all consistent with PCP intoxication. The CT scan of the head showing no abnormalities also supports this diagnosis, as PCP intoxication is typically not associated with significant head trauma or intracranial pathology. The other options are less likely to cause the patient's symptoms, although they may still be contributing factors. For example, the patient's agitation and confusion could be exacerbated by the presence of other substances, such as alcohol or marijuana. However, the primary cause of the patient's symptoms is likely PCP intoxication.

Think step-by-step to answer the following question:


Question -

A 34-year-old man with AIDS comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of decreasing vision and seeing black spots in his right eye. He has no pain and the left eye is asymptomatic. He was treated for fungal esophagitis 6 months ago with fluconazole. He was diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma 2 years ago. Current medications include efavirenz, tenofovir, emtricitabine, azithromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, multivitamins, and a nutritional supplement. He is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 45 kg (99 lbs);BMI is 15.6 kg/m2. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 89/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows cervical lymphadenopathy. There are multiple violaceous plaques seen over his trunk and extremities. Fundoscopic examination shows granular yellow-white opacities around the retinal vessels and multiple areas of dot-blot hemorrhages. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 36/mm3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Choices -

A Cytomegalovirus retinitis
B Herpes simplex keratitis
C Toxoplasma retinitis
D HIV retinopathy
E Varicella zoster retinitis


 Answer -


The correct answer is A Cytomegalovirus retinitis.

Explanation -


The patient's symptoms of decreasing vision and seeing black spots in his right eye, along with the fundoscopic examination showing granular yellow-white opacities around the retinal vessels and multiple areas of dot-blot hemorrhages, are consistent with cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. CMV retinitis is a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS, particularly those with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. The patient's history of fungal esophagitis and Kaposi's sarcoma also increases his risk of developing CMV retinitis. The other options are less likely given the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Herpes simplex keratitis is typically associated with anterior segment inflammation and is less likely to cause the fundoscopic findings described. Toxoplasma retinitis is typically seen in patients with higher CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts and is less likely to cause the granular yellow-white opacities and dot-blot hemorrhages described. HIV retinopathy is a non-specific finding that can occur in patients with AIDS, but it is typically not associated with the specific fundoscopic findings described. Varicella zoster retinitis is typically seen in patients with a history of chickenpox or herpes zoster and is less likely to cause the granular yellow-white opacities and dot-blot hemorrhages described.

Question -

A 65-year-old Asian woman comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. On questioning, she has had occasional night sweats during the past 2 months. She has not had fevers or weight loss. Seven months ago, she had an acute myocardial infarction and was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. She has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 37 years. Current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, ramipril, metoprolol, and esomeprazole. She is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 89 kg (207 lbs); BMI is 29.7 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse is 84/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 145/80 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows an S4. There is a nontender skin lesion near the right large toenail. A photograph of the lesion is shown. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Choices -

A Cholesterol embolism
B Traumatic subungual hemorrhage
C Malignant melanoma
D Onychomycosis
E Squamous cell carcinoma


 Answer -


Answer: C Malignant melanoma

Rationale: The patient has a history of smoking and a skin lesion near the right large toenail, which is a common location for melanoma. The patient's age and history of smoking also increase her risk of developing melanoma. The lesion is not described as being painful or tender, which is consistent with a melanoma. The patient's history of cardiovascular disease and hypertension may also increase her risk of developing melanoma. The other options are less likely given the patient's history and physical examination findings. Cholesterol embolism is a rare condition that typically presents with a livedo reticularis rash, which is not described in this patient. Traumatic subungual hemorrhage is unlikely given the patient's history and physical examination findings. Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that typically presents with a lesion on sun-exposed skin, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is malignant melanoma.

Question -

A 26-year-old African-American woman comes to the physician because of a 4-day history of a nonproductive cough and chest pain. The pain is sharp and worse when she breathes deeply. During this time, she has also had two episodes of hematuria. Over the past 6 months, she has had intermittent pain, stiffness, and swelling in her fingers and left knee. She had two miscarriages at age 22 and 24. Her only medication is minocycline for acne vulgaris. Her temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows an erythematous rash on her face. There is mild tenderness over the metacarpophalangeal joints bilaterally with no warmth or erythema. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?

Choices -

A Anti-histone antibodies
B Low serum levels of C3 and C4
C Prolonged bleeding time
D Erosions of the metacarpophalangeal joints
E Bilateral enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes
F Cytotoxic glomerular antibodies


 Answer -


As a medical professional, I would approach this question by breaking it down into smaller components and considering the patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical examination findings.

The patient presents with a nonproductive cough, chest pain, and hematuria, which suggests a possible pulmonary or renal disorder. The patient's history of intermittent pain, stiffness, and swelling in her fingers and left knee, as well as her history of miscarriages, raises concerns about a possible autoimmune disorder.

The patient's physical examination findings, including the erythematous rash on her face and mild tenderness over the metacarpophalangeal joints, suggest a possible connective tissue disorder.

Given these findings, I would expect the patient's further evaluation to show the following:

* Anti-histone antibodies: This is a common finding in patients with lupus, which is a possible diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Therefore, the correct answer is A, Anti-histone antibodies.

Question -

A 5-month-old male infant is brought to the physician by his mother because of a generalized pruritic rash for 2-weeks. The itchiness often causes the infant to wake up at night. He was strictly breastfed until 4 months of age, when he was transitioned to formula feeding. His father has a history of asthma. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 75th percentile for length and the 70th percentile for weight. Examination shows dry and scaly patches on the face and extensor surfaces of the extremities. The groin is spared. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Choices -

A Topical coal tar
B Oral acyclovir
C Oral vitamin A
D Topical mupirocin
E Topical clotrimazole
F Tar-containing shampoo
G Topical emollient


 Answer: G Topical emollient

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The patient is a 5-month-old male infant with a generalized pruritic rash, which is a common symptom of atopic dermatitis (eczema). The rash is more prominent on the face and extensor surfaces of the extremities, which is consistent with atopic dermatitis.
2. The patient's history of being breastfed until 4 months of age and then transitioned to formula feeding suggests that the rash may be related to the change in diet. This is a common trigger for atopic dermatitis.
3. The patient's father has a history of asthma, which is a common comorbidity with atopic dermatitis.
4. The patient's immunizations are up-to-date, and he is at the 75th percentile for length and the 70th percentile for weight, which suggests that he is generally healthy.
5. The examination shows dry and scaly patches on the face and extensor surfaces of the extremities, which is consistent with atopic dermatitis. The groin is spared, which is also consistent with atopic dermatitis.
6. The most appropriate next step in management is to use a topical emollient to help moisturize the skin and reduce the symptoms of atopic dermatitis. Topical emollients can help to lock in moisture and reduce the risk of further irritation and inflammation.

Therefore, the correct answer is G Topical emollient.

Think step-by-step to answer the following question:


Question -

Two hours after undergoing a left femoral artery embolectomy, an obese 63-year-old woman has severe pain, numbness, and tingling of the left leg. The surgery was without complication and peripheral pulses were weakly palpable postprocedure. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral artery disease, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Prior to admission, her medications included insulin, enalapril, carvedilol, aspirin, and rosuvastatin. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 37.1°C (99.3°F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 132/90 mm Hg. Examination shows a left groin surgical incision. The left lower extremity is swollen, stiff, and tender on palpation. Dorsiflexion of her left foot causes severe pain in her calf. Femoral pulses are palpated bilaterally. Pedal pulses are weaker on the left side as compared to the right side. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 12.1
Leukocyte count 11,300/mm3
Platelet count 189,000/mm3
Serum
Glucose 222 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.1 mg/dL
Urinalysis is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?"

Choices -

A Deep vein thrombosis
B Reperfusion injury
C Rhabdomyolysis
D Cholesterol embolism
E Cellulitis


 Answer -


I would answer that the most likely cause of these findings is B Reperfusion injury. Here's my thought process:

1. The patient had a left femoral artery embolectomy, which means that the artery was blocked and then cleared. This is a high-risk procedure, especially in patients with peripheral artery disease.
2. The patient is experiencing severe pain, numbness, and tingling in the left leg, which is consistent with reperfusion injury. This is a common complication of embolectomy, especially in patients with pre-existing peripheral artery disease.
3. The patient's laboratory studies show a normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count, which makes deep vein thrombosis (A) and rhabdomyolysis (C) less likely.
4. The patient's serum glucose is elevated, which could be related to the reperfusion injury, but it's not a definitive indicator of the cause of the symptoms.
5. The patient's creatinine is normal, which makes rhabdomyolysis (C) less likely.
6. The patient's urinalysis is within normal limits, which makes cellulitis (E) less likely.
7. Cholesterol embolism (D) is a possibility, but it's less likely given the patient's history of peripheral artery disease and the fact that the pedal pulses are weaker on the left side compared to the right side.

Overall, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory studies, and medical history, I believe that reperfusion injury (B) is the most likely cause of these findings.
