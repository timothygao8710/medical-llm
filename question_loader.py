These episodes last for several seconds and occasionally his eyelids flutter. He was born at term and has no history of serious illness. He has met all his developmental milestones. He appears healthy. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Hyperventilation for 30 seconds precipitates an episode of unresponsiveness and eyelid fluttering that lasts for 7 seconds. He regains consciousness immediately afterward. An electroencephalogram shows 3-Hz spikes and waves. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?

Choices -

A Vigabatrin
B Lamotrigine
C Pregabalin
D Clonazepam
E Carbamazepine
F Ethosuximide
